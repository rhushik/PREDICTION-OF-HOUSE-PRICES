# PREDICTION-OF-HOUSE-PRICES
PREDICTING HOUSE PRICES USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project trained and validated a machine learning model to predict house prices in Manhattan. The model was trained on a dataset of historical house sales data, and includes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and amenities. The model was validated to measure accuracy, and achieved a high score.

This project identified the relationships between different variables and visualized the relationships data. The findings can be used to help home buyers and sellers estimate the value of a property, and to track trends in the Manhattan housing market.
